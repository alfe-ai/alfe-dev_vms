To verify the PGP signature in "SHA256SUMS.sign.txt," you typically download the associated public key (e.g., Debianâ€™s official key), and then run a command such as:
  
  gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.sign.txt SHA256SUMS.txt

This compares the signature file against the checksums and confirms the authenticity of those files.
